<!--HTML and XHTML
	XHTML is HTML written as XML
What Is XHTML
	*stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
	*almost identical to HTML
	*stricter than HTML
	*HTML defined as an XML application
	*supported by all major browsers
Why XHTML
	*many pages contain "bad" HTML-->

<html>
<head>
	<title>This is bad HTML</title>

<body>
	<h1><font color="red">Bad</font> HTML
	<p>XHTML is better than HTML, although stricter, due to many pages containing "bad" HTML.
</body>
<!--HTML code works fine in most browsers (even if it doesn't follow HTML rules)-->
