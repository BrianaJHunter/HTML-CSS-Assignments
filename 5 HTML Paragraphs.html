<title>Constant Rush</title>
<p>A rush...</p>
<p>We always seem to be in a rush.</p>




<p>
A rush to get to work
or to our next event
only to rush home.
</p> 
<!--paragraph has a lot of lines in source code; browser ingores-->

<p>
A rush to find the one          to fall in love         to build the perfect life       with one another.
</p>




<p>But what happens when we gain it all<br>without gaining happiness?</p>




<p>
<i>
	But what happens when

	we gain it all

	without gaining

	happiness?
